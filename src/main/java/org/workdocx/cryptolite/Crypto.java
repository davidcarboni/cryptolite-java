/**
 * 
 * This class provides simple encryption and decryption of Strings and streams.
 * <p>
 * This class uses the {@value #CIPHER_ALGORITHM} algorithm in {@value #CIPHER_MODE} mode. This
 * hides the complexity involved in selecting types and values for these and allows the caller to
 * simply request encryption and decryption operations.
 * <p>
 * Some effort has been invested in choosing these values so that they are suitable for the needs of
 * WorkDocx:
 * <ul>
 * <li>AES cipher: NIST standard for the transmission of classified US government data.</li>
 * <li>CTR cipher mode: NIST standard cipher mode.</li>
 * <li>No padding: the CTR cipher mode is a "streaming" mode and therefore does not require padding.
 * </li>
 * <li>Inline initialisation vector: this avoids the need to handle the IV as an additional
 * out-of-band parameter.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Notes on background information used in selecting the cipher, mode and padding:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard</li>
 * </ul>
 * "AES was announced by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as U.S. FIPS PUB 197
 * (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001 after a 5-year standardization process in which fifteen competing
 * designs were presented and evaluated before Rijndael was selected as the most suitable (see
 * Advanced Encryption Standard process for more details). It became effective as a Federal
 * government standard on May 26, 2002 after approval by the Secretary of Commerce. It is available
 * in many different encryption packages. AES is the first publicly accessible and open cipher
 * approved by the NSA for top secret information."
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Beginning Cryptography with Java</li>
 * </ul>
 * "CTR has been standardised by NIST in SP 800-38a and RFC 3686"
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-11-cryptographic-right-answers.html</li>
 * </ul>
 * "AES is about as standard as you can get, and has done a good job of resisting cryptologic
 * attacks over the past decade. Using CTR mode avoids the weakness of ECB mode, the complex (and
 * bug-prone) process of padding and unpadding of partial blocks (or ciphertext stealing), and
 * vastly reduces the risk of side channel attacks thanks to the fact that the data being input to
 * AES is not sensitive."
 * <p>
 * NOTE: CTR mode is "malleable", so if there is a requirement to assure the integrity of the data,
 * on top of encrypting it, this blog recommends adding an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication
 * Code).
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/cryptography/initialisation_vector.shtml</li>
 * </ul>
 * The initialisation vector used in this class is a random one which, according to this site,
 * provides about the same risk of collision as OFB. Given that a relatively small number of items
 * will be encrypted, as compared to a stream of messages which may contain tens of thousands of
 * messages, this makes is a good choice.
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard</li>
 * </ul>
 * U.S. Government announced ... "The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm
 * (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level.
 * TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths". This class has
 * been designed to use 128-bit keys as this does not require unlimited strength encryption and
 * still provides a level of protection equivalent to that used by SECRET level information. Since
 * we are not transmitting these data over the Internet, this seems a reasonable level of
 * protection. It is not clear at the time of writing what the performance impact of using longer
 * keys will be in practice, so this is not a factor in selection of the key size.
